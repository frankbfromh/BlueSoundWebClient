# BlueSoundWebClient
Web based client for BlueSound music streamers.

This little project entertained me while listening to music via my BlueSound Node 2i streamer. The web client is somehwat functional and maybe even a bit useful. I will not be actively developing this any further as I no longer have my BlueSound device. Feel free to make it your own...
